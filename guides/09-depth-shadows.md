The visual aesthetic of Phenotypes is mostly "flat" with a little bit of helpful skeuomorphism. To create a sense of clarity, we try to generally rely on whitespace, typographic hierarchy, and flat colors to provide structure in layouts. Too many gradients and shadows can easily make a design feel cluttered and look dated.

That said, a puristic adherance to "flat design" can lead to experiences that feel like prototypes, so Phenotypes has a system for conveying _depth_ on screen. Depth is a very useful tool for guiding a user through inherently layered experiences like modal dialogs, popovers, and side drawers. A primary call to action button can look a lot more clickable with a subtle shadow to lift it off the screen.

The Phenotypes depth and shadow concepts are inspired by [Material Design's Elevation](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/elevation-shadows.html) principles. Basically, user interface elements slot into prescribed layers in z-space ("z" is often designated as the depth axis). An element's depth determines how much shadow it getsâ€”more shadow implies more distance from the element's container or the substrate of the screen.

Similarly to the spacing system, Phenotypes provides the following **5 depth values**, which are based on the modular scale: **4**, **7**, **11**, **16**, and **24**.

Conceptually, these values correspond to an element being lifted off its container by 4px, 7px, etc. An element that is sitting directly on its container (most elements) have a depth of 0.

### Constructing the shadow

An element with a non-zero depth value gets **three component drop shadows**, the parameters of which are calculated using (you guessed it) the modular scale.

|           | Shadow 1          | Shadow 2           | Shadow 3          |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| **x**     | 0                 | 0                  | 0                 |
| **y**     | `depth / (8/7)^3` | `depth / (8/7)^12` | 0                 |
| **blur**  | `depth * (8/7)^3` | `depth / (8/7)^9`  | `depth * (8/7)^3` |
| **alpha** | `0.14`            | `0.07`             | `0.07`            |

### Organizing the stack

Each depth value corresponds to a functional user interface layer. Most elements can exist at depth 0, so don't go overboard assigning every piece of a layout to different depths. When you need to use depth to clarify hierarchy or provide affordance, do keep elements organized into the following layers.

| Depth  | Function     | Examples                            |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **4**  | Structural   | Cards, header                       |
| **7**  | Interactive  | CTA button                          |
| **11** | Transitional | Hovered CTA button, dragged element |
| **16** | Disclosures  | Popovers, menus                     |
| **24** | Mode switch  | Modal dialogs, side menu            |

An element can move up or down in z-space, perhaps as the result of user interaction. If possible, the element should move from one prescribed depth value to another, with a smooth transition between the two. A subtle change in size and y-position dramatically improves the illusion of a depth transition.
