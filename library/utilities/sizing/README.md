Sizing utility classes are available for setting a width or height on an element. The sizing
utilities share the same modular scale as the [spacing utilities](/components/detail/spacing).

Note: for percentage width layouts, see the [the grid system](/components/detail/grid).

### Classes

```
.width-[size][-breakpoint]
.height-[size][-breakpoint]
```

- `size` is a modular scale number from 0 to 9, or "full" for 100%.
- `breakpoint` is an optional responsive breakpoint (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)

Examples:

- `.width-5`
- `.width-full`
- `.height-3.height-full-xl`
