Responsive grid based on bootstrap 4's grid.

The main customization is that instead of infix modifiers for responsive breakpoints, we switch to suffix modifiers. For example, `.col-md-4` becomes `.col-4-md`.

Read [bootstrap 4 grid docs](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) for more detail.
